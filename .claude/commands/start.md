# /start Command

<!-- What is this command?
     /start is the first thing a user runs when they open this template for a new project.
     It reads the entire template (docs, Claude tools, CLAUDE.md) to understand the structure,
     then interviews the user with plain-English questions until it has enough information to
     fully populate all project files. It replaces the Dream Home Design example content with
     the user's actual product. -->

Guides the user from a blank template to a fully populated project spec through a structured interview.

## When to use it

Run `/start` once, at the very beginning of a new project, before any code is written.

---

## Steps

### Phase 0 — Read the template

Before asking anything, silently read and understand all of the following files:
- `CLAUDE.md` — project guidance structure and tool registry
- `docs/project_spec.md` — product requirements and engineering template
- `docs/architecture.md` — system design template
- `docs/brainstorm.md` — ideation scratchpad template
- `docs/project_status.md` — milestone tracking template
- `docs/changelog.md` — version history template
- `.claude/agents/spec-reviewer.md` — example agent
- `.claude/commands/new-feature.md` — example command
- `.claude/commands/update-docs-and-commit.md` — example command
- `.claude/skills/doc-sync-check/SKILL.md` — example skill

You now understand the full shape of what needs to be filled in. Keep this in mind throughout the interview.

---

### Phase 1 — Open the conversation

Greet the user warmly and explain what is about to happen in one short paragraph. Then ask the first question:

> **What would you like to build?**
> Describe it in plain English — even one sentence is enough to start.

Wait for the answer before continuing.

---

### Phase 2 — Product interview

Ask questions one topic at a time. Never fire more than two questions in a single message. Wait for each answer before moving on. Adjust follow-up questions based on what the user says — do not ask things that are already obvious from their answer.

Work through the following areas in roughly this order, but skip or reorder as context demands:

#### 2a. The problem
- What problem does this product solve?
- Who has this problem? (target user / customer)
- How are people solving it today, and what's wrong with that?

#### 2b. The product
- What does the product actually do, step by step, from the user's point of view?
- What are the two or three most important things a user must be able to do?
- What is explicitly out of scope — what will this NOT do?

#### 2c. Users and use cases
- Walk me through a typical session: what does the user open, do, and see?
- Are there different types of users (e.g. admin vs. end user, free vs. paid)?
- What does success look like for the user?

#### 2d. Data and content
- What data does the product create, store, or display?
- Does the product need user accounts / authentication?
- Are there any external services, APIs, or data sources it must connect to?

#### 2e. Constraints and context
- Is there a deadline or launch date in mind?
- Are there any platforms the product must support (web, iOS, Android, desktop)?
- Any compliance, accessibility, or legal requirements to be aware of?
- Will this be built by you alone, with a team, or with contractors?

Keep asking clarifying questions until you can confidently answer all of the following:
- What is this product in one sentence?
- Who is the primary user?
- What are the top 3–5 user stories?
- What data does it handle?
- What external dependencies does it have?
- What is explicitly out of scope for now?

If something is still unclear after two attempts, make a reasonable assumption, state it explicitly ("I'll assume X — let me know if that's wrong"), and move on.

---

### Phase 3 — Technology

Ask:

> **Do you have a preferred technology stack, or would you like a recommendation?**

**If the user has preferences:** ask them to list what they know or want to use, then confirm the choices make sense for the product. Flag any mismatches (e.g. a heavy framework for a simple static site) and suggest alternatives if relevant.

**If the user wants a recommendation:** research and reason through the best stack based on what you now know about the product. Consider:
- Product type (website, web app, mobile app, API, CLI, data pipeline, etc.)
- Scale and complexity (prototype vs. production, solo dev vs. team)
- User's technical background (if known)
- Ecosystem maturity, hiring pool, hosting options, and cost

Present the recommended stack as a simple table (Layer / Technology / Reason), then ask:

> Does this stack work for you, or would you like to swap anything out?

Adjust based on feedback. Confirm the final stack before moving on.

---

### Phase 4 — Iteration planning

Explain to the user that you will now break the product into delivery iterations. Then propose a plan:

**MVP — the smallest version that delivers real value**
- List only the features that are absolutely necessary to validate the core idea
- Aim for the shortest possible build time
- Everything else goes in a later version

**Version 1.0 — production-ready**
- Adds features needed for a polished public launch (auth, error handling, onboarding, etc.)
- Includes anything the user mentioned that did not make the MVP cut

**Version 2.0+ — growth and scale**
- Nice-to-have features, integrations, performance improvements, monetisation, etc.

Present the iteration plan and ask:

> Does this breakdown look right? Is anything in the wrong phase, or missing entirely?

Adjust based on feedback. Keep iterating until the user says the plan looks good.

---

### Phase 5 — Write all project files

Once the user approves the iteration plan, update all project files to reflect the real product. Replace all example content with the user's actual product.

Update these files in order:

1. **`docs/brainstorm.md`** — clear the example content; add any open questions or undecided ideas that came up during the interview under Active Ideas.

2. **`docs/project_spec.md`** — fill in every section:
   - What Is This Product (one clear paragraph)
   - Who Is It For (user types with descriptions)
   - Features & User Stories (written as "A [user] can [do X] so that [goal]", grouped by area)
   - Tech Stack table
   - System Design Preferences
   - API Design (any endpoints identified)
   - Project Structure (folder and file layout for this specific product)

3. **`docs/architecture.md`** — describe the system design: components, data flow, how the parts connect. Tailor it to the chosen stack and product type.

4. **`docs/project_status.md`** — set up the milestones matching the iteration plan (MVP, v1.0, v2.0+). Mark all as Not Started.

5. **`docs/changelog.md`** — add the first entry: project initialized, date, summary of what was decided.

6. **`CLAUDE.md`** — update the Overview section to describe the real product. The tools section does not need changing — all tools apply to every project.

After writing all files, tell the user what was updated and what they should review.

---

### Phase 6 — Claude tools review

Explain that the template includes three types of reusable tools: agents, commands, and skills. Show the user what exists:

- `.claude/agents/spec-reviewer.md` — reviews the spec before building starts (applies to every project, keep it)
- `.claude/commands/new-feature.md` — adds a new feature to the spec (applies to every project, keep it)
- `.claude/commands/update-docs-and-commit.md` — updates docs and commits after completing work (applies to every project, keep it)
- `.claude/skills/doc-sync-check/SKILL.md` — checks docs are consistent (applies to every project, keep it)

Then ask:

> Based on your project, are there any other repeatable tasks you can think of that would be useful to automate? For example: adding a new record, running a regular check, publishing content, generating a report?

If the user identifies something, write a new tool file for it. Briefly explain what type (agent, command, or skill) makes sense and why, then create the file.

---

### Phase 7 — Wrap up

Confirm everything is done. Give the user a clear next step:

> Your project is set up. Here is how to move forward:
>
> **Right now:**
> 1. Read through `docs/project_spec.md` — does it capture what you want to build?
> 2. If anything is wrong or missing, tell me and I will update it.
>
> **Before you start building:**
> 3. Ask me to "run the spec-reviewer agent" — it will check the spec for gaps before any code is written.
>
> **When you are ready to build:**
> 4. Describe the first feature you want to work on in plain English and I will build it.
>
> **As you go:**
> - Use `/new-feature` any time you want to add something new to the spec
> - Use `/update-docs-and-commit` after finishing any piece of work
> - Ask me to "run the project-advisor agent" any time you want a senior review of where things stand

---

## Rules for the interview

- **Ask one or two questions at a time.** Never present a wall of questions.
- **Use plain English.** Avoid technical jargon unless the user uses it first.
- **Reflect back what you heard.** Before moving to the next topic, briefly restate what you understood. Give the user a chance to correct you.
- **Make assumptions explicit.** If you fill in a gap, say so. ("I'm assuming this will be a web app — is that right?")
- **Never stop early.** Do not write the project files until you can answer all the questions in Phase 2 with confidence.
- **Be encouraging.** This is the start of a project. Keep the tone energetic and collaborative.

## Example opening

```
User runs: /start

Claude says:
  Welcome! I'm going to help you set up your project from scratch.
  I'll ask you a few questions about what you want to build, then
  I'll fill in all the project files — spec, architecture, milestones,
  and more — so you're ready to start building straight away.

  Let's begin with the most important question:

  What would you like to build?
  Describe it however feels natural — even a rough idea is a great start.
```
